"[Stat name,minimum,initial value,maximum]" Square brackets indicate a stat which has a value which must stay within a pair of upper and lower bounds.
"(xCoord,yCoord)" Brackets indicate a cartesian coordinate.

It is advised to use a copy of this file as a template for creating new ship types.
Capitalisation is not regestered by the application so do not reuse names.

#Editing this file is not advised!!! doing so may harm the functioning of the application.;

tracking_distance=40; #The tracking distance is the distance the AI will try to keep it's target inside;
warning_box_min=(-20,-20);
warning_box_max=(20,20); #The warning box is a rectangle drawn around the Ship which causes the AI to evade colisions with other Ships;

hull=[0,0,0]; #The hull is a stat which represents the Ship's 'health'. The Ship is destroyed when the hull hits 0;
turning_speed=0.2093333333333333; #The turning speed is how many radians the Ship can rotate in an update (0.1 seconds);
